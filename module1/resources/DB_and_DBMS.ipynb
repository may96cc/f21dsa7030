    "A database is a collection of data, usually related.  \n",
    "This data is often structured in a contextually relevant manner.  \n",
    "Databases provide access using various methods such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    " * Application Programmer Interface (API)\n",
    " * Custom programs (written using API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Database files exist in a variety of formats, such as\n",
    "\n",
    " * well formed, text files such as a CSV; \n",
    " * proprietary file format, e.g., MS Access or ESRI Shape/Geodatabase; and\n",
    " * Open source, e.g., SQLite or HDF5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these database files are special purpose (e.g., Access, ESRI, or FASTQ), and others are generic (e.g., CSV and SQLite).  \n",

    "Databases come in a variety of styles; however the most predominant structured storage paradigm is the relational model, developed by Edgar Frank \"Ted\" Codd while working at IBM in 1969.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relational model was proposed in his paper \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".\n",

    " * These will be the tables in your database\n",
    " * A table / relation is the instantiation of the Entity for data storage.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tuple** : a fixed-size, ordered set of datums, aka Record, Row.  \n",
